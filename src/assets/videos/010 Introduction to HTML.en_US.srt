00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,270
Welcome back.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,720
Let's now very quickly learn what HTML actually is

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,813
and what we can do with it.

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:16,270
So basically HTML stands for Hypertext Markup language and

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,510
remembered how we learned earlier that HTML is one of the

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,510
core web technologies along with CSS and JavaScript.

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,300
Right, now,

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,300
HTML is a markup language that we web developers can use to

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:39,040
structure and describe the entire content of any webpage.

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,280
So notice how I said markup language,

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,220
because HTML is really not a programming language.

12
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,040
It's a markup language because we use it

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,150
to describe something.

14
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,370
And in the case of HTML,

15
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,170
we do describe content using elements.

16
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,520
So we have different elements that we can use to describe

17
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,580
different types of content. So for example,

18
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:08,450
we have the P element that we already used in the lecture

19
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,860
where we created our very first webpage.

20
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:16,600
And so we use the P element there to create a paragraph,

21
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,130
but we really have all kinds of different elements.

22
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,570
So elements to create links, to create page headings,

23
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,950
images, video, and a lot more,

24
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,200
as you will learn throughout this section.

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,670
And basically throughout the entire course,

26
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,830
then, as we also learned in that lecture

27
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,370
where we built our very first webpage,

28
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:42,400
web browsers, such as Google Chrome,

29
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,970
do essentially understand HTML code and can render it

30
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:50,873
as a final website, so website that we can see

31
00:01:50,873 --> 00:01:53,010
in the browser.

32
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:53,843
Okay.

33
00:01:53,843 --> 00:01:57,330
So this is essentially what HTML is and

34
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,010
what we can do with it.

35
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,960
But now let's just zoom in a little bit and take a look at

36
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,430
the anatomy of a HTML element.

37
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,160
So basically take a look at the building blocks of

38
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,480
each HTML element.

39
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,020
And again, we are looking at the paragraph element here,

40
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,840
as you can see by the P.

41
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,570
And so all of this here is actually the element itself.

42
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:28,360
Now an HTML element is usually made up of three parts.

43
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,360
First is the opening tag, which is the name of the element.

44
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,550
So in this case,

45
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:39,420
it's the P wrapped in the less than in the greater den

46
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,270
symbols, probably they have some other names,

47
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,880
but that's how I like to call the symbols.

48
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,700
So it's less than P and then greater than.

49
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,150
Then, after that,

50
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,030
we have basically the content of the element.

51
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,940
So in this example, that is just text,

52
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,550
but there might be other types of content.

53
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:04,050
For example, an element can contain in itself,

54
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,240
another element which we then call a child element.

55
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,230
Also some elements such as images have actually

56
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:16,530
no content at all and have only an opening tech.

57
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,450
And all of this will of course become

58
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,930
very intuitive as we start writing HTML.

59
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,100
This is just so that,

60
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,380
you know what I'm talking about when I speak of opening tag

61
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:32,380
or closing tag or content, and speaking of the closing tag,

62
00:03:32,814 --> 00:03:36,110
it is basically the same as the opening tag,

63
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,230
but with a slash.

64
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:42,280
So it opens its paragraph element simply with the P

65
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,510
and we then close it with slash P, okay.

66
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,670
Now for elements that do not have content

67
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,270
such as the image element that I mentioned before,

68
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,460
we actually omit the closing tag. So in that case,

69
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,010
we only have the opening tag and that's it,

70
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,940
and we will see that in action of course

71
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:06,600
once we start integrating images into a webpage.

72
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,230
Okay, and that's really,

73
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:12,400
all you need in order to start learning HTML and practice,

74
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,773
which is exactly what we will do in the next lecture.
